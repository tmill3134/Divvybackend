# Divvy Challenge

This challenge was a lot of fun. I was able to find a Javascript solution fairly quickly.  Once you realize the amount the numbers are increasing by is incrementing on each position, it is pretty easy to find the position of one of the axis and work from there.

Once I had my Javascript solution I was able to convert it to Elixir and solve the problem recursively.  I am confident enough in my solution that I will point out that I think the solution for [100000, 100000] in the document is incorrect. The document says that it is 20000000001, and I believe it should be 19999800001.

I really enjoyed the challenges and the learning opportunity that came with them!


## Installation
To test my Javascript solution, run `node index.js` outside of `divvychallenge` folder.

To test my Elixir solution, `cd` into `divvychallenge` folder and run `mix test`.
